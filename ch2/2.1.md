Abstract over common data that is variable (somewhat contived):

```js
// shopping cart maths, cost * items

// no
10 * 11
10 * 7

//yes
const priceOfItems = items => 10 * items
priceOfItems(11)
priceOfItems(7)
```

Don't ever stop abstracting!

```js
const priceOfItems = (price, items) => price * items
```

What if we want to find how many items we have though?

```js
const numberOfItems = (price, items) => price / items
```
