Recall previous functions:

```js
const identity = x => x
const apply = fn => arg => fn(arg)
const selfApply = s => s(s)
```

> We can use the self application function to build versions of other functions.

```js
// def identity2 = Î»x.((apply identity) x)

const identity2 =
  x => (
    apply(
      apply(apply)(identity)
    )(x)
  )
```
