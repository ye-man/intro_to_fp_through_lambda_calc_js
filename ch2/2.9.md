Recall previous functions:

```js
const identity = x => x
const apply = fn => arg => fn(arg)
```

### Selecting the first of two arguments

```js
// def select_first = λfirst.λsecond.first

const selectFirst = first => second => first
selectFirst(1)(2) // => 1
```

### Selecting the second of two arguments

```js
// def select_second = λfirst.λsecond.second

const selectSecond = first => second => second
selectFirst(1)(2) // => 2
```

Which oddly enough is just another version of `identity`.

### Making pairs from two arguments

```js
// def make_pair = λfirst.λsecond.λfunc.((func first) second)

const add = a => b => a + b
const makePair =
  first => second => fn => apply(apply(fn)(first))(second)
```

Talking through this one makes it easier to understand. `makePair` takes an argument and returns a function, twice. Then it returns a function that takes an function as an argument, applies the first arg to that function, then the second, producing the result. Note that to get this to all work in JS land you have to return a function for the function that takes two arguments (aka currying).

> In general, applying `makePair` ro arbitrary arguments gives:

```
λfunc.((func <argument1>) <argument2>)
```
