> The λ calculus is a system for manipulating λ expressions. A λ expression may be a name to identify an abstraction point, a function to introduce an abstraction or a function application to specialize an abstraction.

```
<expression> ::= <name> | <function> | <application>
```

A <strong>name</strong> be any sequence of non-blank characters, e.g. variables.

A <strong>λ function</strong> is an abstraction over a λ expression and has the form:

```
<function> ::= <name>.<body>
```

Where: `<body> ::= <expression>`.

For example:

```
λx.x
λx.λy.x
```

Is synonymous with:

```js
x => x
x => y => x
```

The λ precedes the `<name>` used for abstraction, also called the functions <strong>bound variable</strong>. In JavaScript this would be the arguments for a function. They are bound and only used in the body of the function.

Function application:

```
<application> ::= (<function expression> <argument expression>)
```

For example:

```
(λx.x λa.λb.b)
```

In function application, the function expression is said to be <strong>applied to</strong> the argument expression. If we want to apply functions outputs to other functions inputs, we need to do a little work:

```js
const plusOne = x => x + 1
const plusTwo = x => x + 2

const apply = (argExp, fnExp) => argExp(fnExp())

apply(
  plusOne.bind(null, 1),
  plusTwo.bind(null, 1)
) // => 4
```
