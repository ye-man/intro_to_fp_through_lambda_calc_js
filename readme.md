Using this repo to study and write up JS interpretations of the examples found in [Introduction to Functional Programming Through Lambda Calculus by Greg Michaelson](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486478831).

Included is a nice little JavaScript REPL that is useful for trying things as you go along. Here's how to set it up:

- run `npm install`
- rename `index.example.js` to `index.js`
- run `npm run start`
- ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°
